# preeclampsia
- disorder of pregnancy associated with new-onset hypertension, usually with accompanying proteinuria, which occurs most often after 20 weeks of gestation and frequently near term
- beginning with gestational hypertension and progressing to develop severe features, ultimately leading to its more severe manifestations, such as eclampsia and HELLP syndrome

### diagnosis
pregnancy-induced hypertension a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140 mm Hg or more or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 mm Hg or more on 2 occasions at least 4 hours apart\
or shorter interval timing in cases of "severe range" hypertension with SBP of 160 mm Hg or more or DBP of 110 mm Hg or more, all of which must be identified <mark>after 20 weeks of gestation.</mark>\
Such criteria identified before 20 weeks of gestation would be defined as pre-existing essential hypertension or "chronic hypertension.

> [!TIP]
>  classical triad of hypertension, edema, and proteinuria transitioning to hypertension and organ dysfunction (ie, renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematological, or uteroplacental.)

## etiology
 poorly understood but mostly due to uteroplacental ischemia

 ## risk factors
 - prior chronic hypertension
 - diabetes mellitus
 - renal disease, obesity
 - short stature
 - nutritional deficiencies
 - gestational hypertension in previous pregnancies
 - heredity
 - autoimmune disorders (systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome)
 - hydatidiform mole
 - multiple pregnancies
 - fetal macrosomia
 - nulliparity
 - advanced maternal age
 - high BMI and assisted reproduction

## Pathophysiology
- categorized into 2 subtypes: early-onset ( or placental) and late-onset (or maternal) preeclampsia.
- early-onset ( or placental) preeclamptic placenta reveals numerous placental infarcts and arterial sclerosis.\
  This is accompanied by placental hypoperfusion due to altered trophoblast invasion and, thus, placental ischemia

## History
- a new-onset headache that is unresponsive to medication, may or may not be accompanied by additional complaints of visual disturbance
- may also endorse right upper quadrant or epigastric pain with associated nausea or vomiting.
- shortness of breath and a perceived increase in swelling, both worsening from baseline pregnancy-related symptoms, may also be reported.

## physical exam
- v/s to assess HTN and diagnose
- dyspnea -> auscultate lung sounds
- palpation of R.t upper quadrant for tenderness
- evaluate edema

## labs
- urine analysis to evaluate presence of proteinuria (urine dipstick result >= 2+)
- 24 hours urine collection >= 300mg
- urine protein to creatinine ratio 0.3 or greater
- cbc for thrombocytopenia
- liver and kidney function

## management
- focusing on adequate blood pressure control and seizure prevention.
- **Antihypertensive Management**
  - Beta-blockers, such as labetalol
  - Calcium-channel blockers, such as nifedipine
  - Alpha-2 agonists, such as clonidine
  - Vasodilators, such as hydralazine
- **for severe hypertension >=160/110**
  - IV labetalol
  - IV hydralazine
  - PO immediate-release nifedipine.
- **Antiseizure Management:**
  - IV magnesium sulfate therapy
    - if magnesium sulfate IV is contraindicated, leviteracetam can be used for prophylaxis.
- **Management of eclampsia if occur**
  - initially with an IV benzodiazepine medication
  - For recurrent seizures despite magnesium sulfate IV (or if it is contraindicated), alternative medications include:
    - Lorazepam
    - Diazepam
    - Phenytoin
    - Levetiracetam
  - **Antepartum Management and Delivery Timing:**
  - ultrasonography of the amniotic fluid index and estimated fetal weight
  - antenatal testing, such as non-stress tests and biophysical profiles

> Ultimately, the definitive treatment of preeclampsia is the delivery of the fetus.

> [!TIP]
> As per ACOG, it is recommended that patients at 37 0/7 weeks gestation diagnosed with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia without severe features should undergo delivery rather than expectant management.
>  
>  It is also recommended that patients diagnosed with preeclampsia with severe features at or beyond 34 0/7 weeks gestation undergo delivery after maternal stabilization and should not be delayed to accommodate steroid

Findings that indicate expeditious delivery after stabilization, regardless of gestational age, can be described as fetal and maternal factors.
- **Fetal factors include**
  - abnormal antepartum testing and sustained reversed end-diastolic flow of the umbilical artery
- **Maternal factors include**
  - uncontrolled blood pressure
  - continued headaches/visual disturbance or right upper quadrant/epigastric pain despite repeated medical management
  -  myocardial infarction
  -  stroke
  -  pulmonary edema
  -  HELLP syndrome
  -  eclampsia
  -  suspicion of placental abruption or bleeding with no other diagnosis

delivery before 34 0/7 weeks gestation, if indicated, should prompt the administration of antenatal steroids for fetal lung maturation, but this should not delay delivery. This also applied to the late preterm period of 34 0/7 through 36 6/7 weeks gestation. 

### complications
- Delayed delivery of the fetus in preeclamptic patients in the late preterm period increases the risk of severe hypertension, with severe consequences such as: 
  - eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, pulmonary edema, myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, stroke, renal and retinal injury
  - fetal complications including fetal growth restrictions, placental abruption, or fetal or maternal death
- Common complications exist with the initiation of medical management for adequate blood pressure control These include:
  - tachycardia, hypotension, headaches
  - fetal heart tracing abnormalities when using labetalol, hydralazine, or nifedipine
  - The use of magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis also carries additional adverse effects and complication risks such as respiratory depression and cardiac arrest
    - Thus, frequent laboratory testing of serum magnesium levels and physical examinations every 4 to 6 hours for magnesium sulfate therapy patients is recommended.
