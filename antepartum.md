# ANTENATAL

## Antepartum Care in the first trimester
- Initial Prenatal Visit Ideally in the first trimester
- Components of the initial prenatal visit should include a complete medical history, physical exam, pregnancy confirmation,\
initial prenatal screening tests, genetic screening or diagnostic studies, Additionally,\
an obstetrical ultrasound crown-rump length (CRL)( is the length of the embryo or fetus from the top of its head to bottom of torso.\
It is the most accurate estimation of gestational age in early pregnancy, because there is little biological variability at that time)
- assessment at ≤14 weeks gestation is beneficial in accurately calculating fetal gestational age and is recommended\
if a patient's last menstrual period is unreliable or unknown

### Clinical history
- Medical history, including demographic information (eg, occupation, race and ethnicity, marital status), religious or other restrictions\
  (eg, receiving blood products and dietary restrictions), medications, and immunizations
- Obstetrical and gynecologic history, including if the current pregnancy was intended, menstrual regularity, and last menstrual period
- Family history, including genetic conditions and disorders in multiple family members
- Surgical history
- Social history, including recent travel, tobacco use, alcohol and drug use, and histories of sexual trauma or intimate partner violence
- Psychosocial assessments 

### Physical examination
A complete physical examination should also be performed, including complete vital signs, maternal weight, pelvic examination,\
fundal height, and, depending on the gestational age at presentation, fetal heart rate

A positive screening result for hypertension during pregnancy is a systolic blood pressure of ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥90 mm Hg
measured twice at least 4 hours apart in a patient without chronic hypertension

Furthermore, maternal body mass index (BMI) should be calculated at the initial prenatal visit as a BMI of ≥30 kg/m2 is associated with a higher risk of several\
pregnancy complications, including fetal death, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and preterm birth than patients with a normal BMI.

During the pelvic examination, uterine size should be assessed to correlate with the estimated gestational age calculated by the last menstrual period\
if an incongruity is noted, further evaluation with ultrasound is indicated.

### Pregnancy confirmation 

#### **1. Why Check for Pregnancy?**  
- Women with **missed periods (amenorrhea), abdominal pain, or irregular bleeding** should be tested for pregnancy first.  
- Pregnancy is confirmed using **hormone tests (β-hCG)** and **ultrasound**.  

#### **2. Pregnancy Tests (β-hCG)**  
- **Urine Test (Home Pregnancy Test)**  
  - Detects **β-hCG** in urine (best with **first-morning urine** since it’s more concentrated).  
  - Positive = Likely pregnant, but **does not confirm a healthy pregnancy**.  
- **Blood Test (Serum β-hCG, more accurate)**  
  - Measures exact hormone levels.  
  - Helps track if pregnancy is progressing (levels should **double every 48 hours** in early pregnancy).  

#### **3. When is Ultrasound Needed?**  
- **β-hCG alone doesn’t confirm a normal pregnancy** (could be ectopic, miscarriage, or molar pregnancy).  
- **Transvaginal ultrasound** can see a pregnancy sac at **5-6 weeks**.  
- **"Discriminatory Zone"** (Key Concept):  
  - If **β-hCG > 3,500 mIU/mL**, a sac **should** be seen on ultrasound.  
  - If **no sac is seen**, it may mean:  
    - **Ectopic pregnancy** (dangerous, grows outside the uterus).  
    - **Early miscarriage**.  

#### **4. What If β-hCG is Low or Not Doubling?**  
- **Normal pregnancy**: β-hCG doubles in 48 hours.  
- **Abnormal pregnancy**:  
  - **Slow rise** → Possible miscarriage.  
  - **Falling levels** → Miscarriage or ectopic resolving.  
  - **High but no baby on ultrasound** → Molar pregnancy (abnormal tissue growth).  

#### **5. Final Confirmation**  
- **Ultrasound is the gold standard** to confirm:  
  - Baby is in the uterus (not ectopic).  
  - Heartbeat is present (viable pregnancy).  

### **Summary:**  
1. **Urine/blood test (β-hCG) → Detects pregnancy.**  
2. **Ultrasound → Confirms if pregnancy is normal (in uterus, with heartbeat).**  
3. **If β-hCG is high but no baby seen → Possible ectopic or miscarriage.**  

### Initial prenatal laboratory studies

ACOG recommends performing a standardized prenatal laboratory panel on every new obstetrical patient at the first visit, including:
- **complete blood count** (CBC)\
  In the first and third trimesters, a hemoglobin level of <11 g/dL or in the second trimester <10.5 g/dL indicates anemia during pregnancy.\
  A mean corpuscular volume of <80 fL may indicate anemia due to etiologies, including iron deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, or thalassemia.\
  Conditions including folate and vitamin B12 deficiency or alcohol abuse are suggested by a mean corpuscular volume >100 fL
  
- **ABO and RhD type** (neonates with ABO incompatibility frequently develop hyperbilirubinemia)
  - **What is ABO Incompatibility?**
    - Occurs when a mother’s blood type (O) has antibodies against her baby’s blood type (A or B).\
    Mom’s anti-A or anti-B IgG antibodies cross the placenta and attack baby’s red blood cells 
    Less severe than Rh incompatibility but still causes hemolysis (RBC breakdown).

### RH incompatibility
A condition where an Rh-negative mother carries an Rh-positive baby, risking an immune reaction that can harm the baby.

If fetal Rh+ blood mixes with mom’s Rh- blood (e.g., during delivery, trauma, or miscarriage), mom’s immune system sees Rh+ cells as "foreign" and makes anti-D antibodies.\
In future pregnancies, these antibodies can cross the placenta and attack an Rh+ baby’s RBCs → Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus/Newborn (HDFN).\
Causes severe anemia, jaundice, hydrops fetalis (a condition where fluid builds up in a fetus's tissues and organs, causing swelling (edema)), or stillbirth.

### How is it Prevented?
- Anti-D Immunoglobulin (RhoGAM) is given to Rh- moms:\
  - Routine dose at 28 weeks (to prevent sensitization during late pregnancy).
- After delivery (if baby is Rh+).
- After any event causing fetomaternal hemorrhage (miscarriage, trauma, amniocentesis).
it Stops mom’s immune system from making anti-D antibodies, protecting future babies.

- **rubella serology**
  Determines rubella immunity defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a rubella immunoglobulin G concentration of **>10 IU/mL**.
- **Urine Culture**
  to identify asymptomatic bacteriuria, Colony counts of **≥100,000 CFU/mL** are diagnostic of bacteriuria\
  ACOG and the USPSTF recommend clinicians screen for asymptomatic bacteria with a urine culture to prevent pyelonephritis.\
  USPSTF recommends performing the urine culture at 12 to 16 weeks gestation or at the first prenatal visit, while ACOG only states it should be done at an early visit.\
  However, collecting these laboratory studies simultaneously during the initial prenatal visit is typically easier for the clinician and the patient
  Treat with targeted antibiotics for 5 to 7 days
- **syphilis serology**
  **Parenteral benzathine penicillin G** is the recommended treatment for active syphilis infection during pregnancy.
- **hepatitis B serology**
  Screening for infection with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is recommended by USPSTF in all pregnant patients
- **HIV serology**



ACOG also recommends targeted evaluation for some conditions in patients with risk factors, including **diabetes and thyroid disease**.

Early testing for type 2 diabetes with a 75-g or 50-g oral glucose tolerance test is recommended by ACOG at the initial prenatal visit in\
patients who have a BMI of ≥30 kg/m2 and 1 of the following risk factors:\

- History of gestational diabetes mellitus 
- Hemoglobin A1C ≥5.7% on previous testing
- Immediate family member with diabetes
- High-risk race (eg, African American, Latin American, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander)
- Cardiovascular disease history
- Hypertension 
- High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level <35 mg/dL or a triglyceride level >250 mg/dL
- Polycystic ovary syndrome
- Physical inactivity 


ACOG recommends targeted testing for thyroid disease in patients with the following risk factors:


- Residing in an area of moderate to severe iodine insufficiency
- Hypothyroidism symptoms
- Family of thyroid disease
- History of:
  - Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies
      - TPO may mean you have thyroid disease due to an immune system condition called Hashimoto's disease. With Hashimoto's disease, the immune system makes antibodies that attack healthy tissue by accident. Antibodies that attack the thyroid can cause swelling, called inflammation, in the gland
  - Goiter
- Age >30 years
- Type 1 diabetes
- Head and neck radiation
- Recurrent miscarriage or preterm delivery
- Two or more previous pregnancies
- BMI ≥40 kg/m2
- Infertility
- Thyroid surgery or disease
- Recent administration of iodinated radiologic contrast agents, amiodarone, or lithium

Targeted screening assessment should also be considered for patients with clinical risks of infection, including Zika virus, cytomegalovirus, and tuberculosis.

Papanicolaou test, as recommended per current guidelines, and gonorrhea and chlamydia cultures should be obtained during the pelvic examination at the initial visit.

Clinicians should also offer all pregnant patients prenatal screening and diagnostic testing for genetic disorders at the first visit.\
Thorough counseling on available genetic screening and diagnostic testing options (eg, cell-free DNA, serum-integrated screening, nuchal translucency screening, and chorionic villus sampling) depending on gestational age is critical to ensure patients are able to make informed decisions regarding the pregnancy

### Estimated due date determination and first-trimester ultrasound

According to ACOG, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine,\
a first-trimester ultrasound measurement (ie, no more than 13 6/7 weeks gestation) of the fetus is the most accurate modality to confirm an\
intrauterine pregnancy and determine the estimated gestational age (EGA)

**Stage              Best Method	      Accuracy	        Purpose**
- ≤13 ⁶⁄₇ weeks	      CRL	              ±5–7 days	        Confirm viability, set EDD
- 14–22 weeks    	    BPD, HC, AC, FL	  ±7–10 days	      Monitor growth (do not reset EDD)
- ≥22 weeks	          Biometry	        ±2–3 weeks	      Assess growth, detect anomalies

    - Fetal growth restriction
    - Multiple gestation
    - Fetal anomalies or aneuploidy
    - Decreased fetal movement

- **Maternal indications**
    - Diabetes (gestational or preexisting)
    - Systemic lupus erythematous
