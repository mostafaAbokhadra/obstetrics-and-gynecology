# Antepartum
- the health care provided during pregnancy
- The primary objectives are to identify high-risk pregnancies and to monitor the health of the mother and the development of the fetus. 


### Smoking, alcohol, and illicit drug use 
**Tobacco** use during pregnancy is associated with miscarriage, congenital anomalies,\
fetal demise, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, placental abruption,\
sudden infant death syndrome, and pulmonary dysfunction

counsel patients extensively regarding risk factors associated with cigarette use during pregnancy,\
and implement a quitting plan with the identification of foreseeable roadblocks and obstacles to doing so.\
Behavioral therapy is the preferred method to facilitate tobacco cessation in pregnant patients.

**alcohol use** during pregnancy is associated with adverse effects,\including neurological impairment and
fetal alcohol spectrum disorder(mental and physical problems in the baby) (most frequently reported in infants of individuals who ingest >6 drinks a day)\

patients must completely abstain from alcohol use during pregnancy to prevent alcohol's teratogenic effects

**illicit drug use**, including prescription opioids during pregnancy, is also of significant concern to both maternal and\
fetal outcomes, Adverse effects of substance abuse include teratogenic effects, neonatal abstinence syndrome (Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (also called NAS)\
is a condition that occurs when a baby withdraws from certain drugs they were exposed to during pregnancy.\
It is most often caused by opioids, including prescription pain relievers like codeine, hydrocodone (Vicodin®),\
oxycodone (OxyContin®), and tramadol, as well as street drugs like heroin (also an opioid).\
You may hear NAS also called NOWS. NOWS stands for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. NOWS is the same as NAS\
except it’s caused only by opioids. NAS can also result from exposure to antidepressants, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines\
(sleeping pills).) developmental impairment, and comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety, and infectious diseases

Management of pregnant patients with substance abuse disorders is multifocal, including referral to addiction specialists\
and rehabilitation programs, infectious disease testing, mental health screening, ultrasound assessment, and antenatal fetal surveillance

### Physical activity
Exercise during pregnancy has several benefits, including decreasing the risk of gestational diabetes,\
hypertensive disorders, operative deliveries, excessive gestational and postpartum weight gain, and postpartum depression

ACOG recommends that after thorough clinical evaluation and with no contraindications, pregnant women should be encouraged to participate in regular,\
moderate-intensity physical activity in sessions of 30 to 45 minutes daily for approximately 150 minutes each week, depending on their starting fitness level

Clinicians should advise patients to gauge exercise intensity by perceived exertion instead of heart rate, which may be affected by pregnancy

patients should be instructed to accommodate exercise for pregnancy by avoiding the supine position since this will put pressure on the vena cava and compromise\
blood return to the heart, potentially compromising the blood flow to the fetus. Patients should avoid overexertion and dehydration by exercising in a temperature-controlled\
environment, wearing loose clothing, and remaining well-hydrated

Exercise activities considered safe in pregnancy include walking, stationary cycling, aerobic dancing, resistance exercises, stretching, swimming, and water aerobics.

These warning signs include regular painful contractions, vaginal bleeding, dyspnea on exertion, dizziness, headache, chest pain, or calf pain. If these symptoms should occur,\
the pregnant patient should stop exercising and consult with her clinician immediately

**Relative contraindications** to exercise during pregnancy include
- heavy smoking
- poorly controlled disorders (eg, seizure disorder, hyperthyroidism, type 1 diabetes, or hypertension)
- morbid obesity, malnutrition
- intrauterine growth restriction
- chronic bronchitis
- unevaluated maternal cardiac arrhythmia
- history of a severely sedentary lifestyle
- symptomatic or severe anemia
- and heavy smoking.
-
**Absolute contraindications** include
- incompetent cervix or cerclage
- multifetal gestations with an increased risk of preterm delivery
- persistent vaginal bleeding
- preterm labor
- placenta previa present after 26 weeks gestation
- rupture of membranes
- preeclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension
- significant heart disease
- restrictive lung disease.
- Activities in which the risk of trauma to the abdomen or falls is increased should be avoided\
  (e.g., skydiving, scuba diving, contact sports, horseback riding, hot yoga, and gymnastics).
- Heavy weightlifting and long-distance running are also discouraged due to overexertion and dehydration risks

### Travel
- you may safely travel until 36 weeks of gestation
- patients should be advised that when obstetric emergencies occur during travel, they most commonly happen in the first and third trimesters.
- Patients are advised to ambulate every hour on long flights to prevent thromboembolism and to wear seat belts throughout the flight
